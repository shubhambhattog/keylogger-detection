# Enhanced Keylogger Detection Project

An advanced machine learning approach for real-time keylogger detection in network traffic with explainability and production readiness.

## 🎯 Quick Overview

- **High Accuracy**: 99.9%+ detection accuracy
- **Real-time**: 4.5ms latency, 63+ predictions/second  
- **Explainable**: Complete SHAP analysis for transparency
- **Production Ready**: Edge deployment capable (10.1 MB footprint)
- **Secure**: Adversarial robustness tested and quantified

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run main analysis
python main.py

# Run specific analyses
python scripts/simple_shap.py
python scripts/realtime_deployment_simulation.py
```
